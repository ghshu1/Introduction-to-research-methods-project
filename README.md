I am writing about the use of gendered and gender neutral pronouns in English literature. Gendered pronouns are he, she, his, her, etc. I want to find out if there has been a shift in the usage of gendered/neutral pronouns throughout the years. Maybe some pronouns were used much more frequently in the past, while others are rarely used. Maybe that has changed at some point in time. I don’t know, so that’s what I want to research.

Motivation: The usage of gendered pronouns can be influenced by the view our society has on genders. The way authors depict these genders in various literature can be representative of the general public’s view of genders. Historically, English books often only used male or female pronouns. However, in recent years there has been a focus on gender-neutral pronouns. These changes will be studied through Project Gutenburg’s corpus. If there has been a significant shift in the usage of these pronouns, it may provide insight into society’s attitudes towards genders, and how they change over time.

Research question: Has the usage of gendered and neutral pronouns changed over time in English literature?

Hypothesis: The usage of neutral pronouns is increasing over time compared to gendered pronouns in English literature.

Independent Variable: Time period (work from 1900s, work from 2000s)
Dependent Variable: Frequency of gendered pronouns (he, she, his, her, they, etc.)

Method: 
Pick an English book from the Project Gutenberg corpus from the 1900s and the 2000s.
Count the frequency of gendered/neutral pronouns in each book
Count the total number of pronouns in each book
Get the relative frequency of gendered/neutral pronouns in each book
